# Trio
A set of modular instruments for kids meant to spark creativity and improve collaboration skills. Created for my final thesis at the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design. Includes code and media files for all prototypes leading up to the final version.

Final Arduino work was done with MKR 1010 boards which require a header file containing WiFi Network Information. The arduinosecrets.h files are removed for privacy throughout the project but can be added back in by including the file and login information:
```
#define SECRET_SSID "My Network"
#define SECRET_PASS "My Password"
```
